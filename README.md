# Dutch Azure Meetup September 23rd 2021

Welcome to the Dutch Azure Meetup, Schuber Philis edition. We have prepared a small hands-on lab for you to play around with a few Azure concepts, which we mention during our sessions.

Before you begin, you will need a clean Azure environment. To facilitate that, you have been provided with Azure Pass - a limited sponsorship subscription from Microsoft. 
Please follow the provided guide to configure your Azure Pass, even if you've done that before. The lab depends on it!

When you're ready with your lab environment, you can try the exercises we have prepared for tonight. The first one guides you through what we consider a minimal day zero setup, and the second one extends it with monitoring.
Don't worry if you aren't able to finish within the time we have planned for the lab - these instructions will remain public indefinitely, and your Azure Pass will stay valid for thirty days!

1) [Configure your Azure Pass](./instructions/azurePass.md)
2) [Day Zero AzureAD and Azure setup](./instructions/dayZero.md)
3) [Azure AD monitoring](./instructions/monitoring.md)

We hope you have a great time. If you need any support please find one of our colleagues, they'll be happy to help!
